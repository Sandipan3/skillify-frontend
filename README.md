# Skillify Backend

Backend API for **Skillify**, a modern Learning Management System (LMS). This service handles authentication, course-related operations, payments, media uploads, caching, and email workflows.

The goal of this backend is to be **secure, scalable, and production‑ready** while staying developer-friendly.

## Tech Stack

**Core**

- Node.js (ES Modules)
- Express.js
- MongoDB + Mongoose

**Auth & Security**

- JWT authentication
- bcrypt password hashing
- Google OAuth (Passport)
- Express rate limiting
- Cookie parser
- CORS

**Performance**

- Redis (ioredis) for caching / rate limiting

**Media Handling**

- Multer
- Cloudinary

**Payments**

- Razorpay

**Email**

- Nodemailer

**Dev Tools**

- Nodemon
- Morgan

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sandipan3/skillify-backend.git
cd skillify-backend
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Create environment variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory.

```env
PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret

# Redis
REDIS_URL=your_redis_url

# Cloudinary
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=

# Google OAuth
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=

# Razorpay
RAZORPAY_KEY_ID=
RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET=

# Email
EMAIL_USER=
EMAIL_PASS=
```

> Never commit your `.env` file.

## Security Notes

- Passwords are hashed using bcrypt
- Rate limiting helps prevent brute-force attacks
- Sensitive values are stored in environment variables
- JWT is used for stateless authentication

---

## Future Improvements

- Refresh token rotation
- API documentation (Swagger)
- Docker support
